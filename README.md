Implement some outlier detection algorithms in Python
* LOF
* COF
* ODIN

Currently, it depends on Numpy, Scipy, Cython and NetworkX

Inspired by http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.scikit-learn/10729

Since there was no update on that thread, I think I can implement 
something quickly and later update to conform to scikit-learn coding style.
